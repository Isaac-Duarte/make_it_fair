# Make it fair

This project is an external radar for Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) designed specifically for Linux. It provides a detailed and extensible interface for retrieving and visualizing in-game player data. The offsets should rarely need to be updated as they are scanned before the process launches. It is meant to be publicly pasted into a lobby for trolling purposes
